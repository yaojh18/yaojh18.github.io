  <p>
    I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington. I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~banghua/">Banghua Zhu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yuliats/">Yulia Tsvetkov</a>. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University.

    My research interests primarily focus on <b>Large Foundation Models</b>:
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Reliability</b>: Investigate whether models can recognize their knowledge gaps and abstain when uncertain. This enhances trustworthiness and minimizes risks in high-stakes domains such as medical applications.</li>
      <li> <b>Evaluation</b>: Address biases in model evaluation and align with human preferences, particularly in multi-modal tasks. This will establish standardized, fair, and reliable evaluation protocols for large foundation models.</li>
      <li> <b>Alignment</b>: Explore data-centric approaches to optimize the alignment process. This can expand the capabilities of large foundation models under only limited high-quality data and potentially enable self-improvement.</li>
    </ul>
