 Abstention, the refusal of large language models (LLMs) can be categorized from three perspectives: query answerability, model knowledge, and human values. We organize the literature on abstention methods, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics using this framework, and discuss merits and limitations of prior work. We further identify and motivate areas for future work.
